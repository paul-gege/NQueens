# NQueens
NQueens problem solved using genetic evolution algorithm

## Description
NQueens problem is a problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens attack eachother. It can be solved in other ways such as recursively finding the solution and looping to find solutions. However, using simple a simple evolutionary algorithm, one can work their way towards a solution or all solutions as well. The following code is a simple Java implementation of an evolutionary algorithm to find the solution.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
Simply import the repository into a Java IDE, enter the number of queens (try numbers between 8-10)
